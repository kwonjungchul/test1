2024-07-06 13:16:44,577 INFO:Received code: def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

2024-07-06 13:16:46,582 INFO:Analysis result: The provided code is correct, follows PEP8 guidelines, and has a simple functionality of adding two numbers together.

Here is the code with PEP8 guidelines applied:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Explanation of changes:
1. The function `add_numbers` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.
2. The code is properly formatted with correct indentation and follows PEP8 guidelines.

No corrections are needed as the code is already correct and follows best practices.
